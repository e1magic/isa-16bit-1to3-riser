This is a 1-to-3 ISA riser board designed to expand the number of ISA slots in a compact PC setup. It allows you to connect three additional ISA slots to a single ISA slot on the main motherboard (typically a mini-ATX or micro-ATX board), using a flat ribbon cable or edge connector.

🔧 Features
1 ISA input → 3 ISA outputs

Designed for integration in tight ATX cases alongside mini-ATX motherboards
Compact PCB layout optimized for side-mounting or vertical stacking

📦 Use Case
Perfect for retrocomputing projects where you need to add multiple ISA expansion cards (e.g. sound cards, network adapters, custom I/O boards) in a limited space setup.

🧩 Integration Example
Insert the main ribbon cable from the motherboard’s ISA slot
Mount the riser PCB near the motherboard inside the ATX chassis
Connect up to 3 full-size 8-bit or 16-bit ISA cards

📁 Included Files
This repository includes Gerber files for two layout variants:

1.Motherboard-side cable orientation – for placing the riser PCB near the ISA slot of the mini-ATX/micro-ATX motherboard
2.Opposite-side cable orientation – for mounting the riser elsewhere in the case with flexible routing

🛠️ Connector Options
The riser’s input can be connected via:

1. Ribbon cable with header pins.
2. Vertical edge connector mounted directly to the board
(e.g. for slot-in installation or backplane-style mounting)
This dual-option design allows for preserving access to adjacent PCI slots on the motherboard, minimizing interference in mixed ISA/PCI setups.

Gerber previews and PCB renders are located in the gerbers/ folder.
